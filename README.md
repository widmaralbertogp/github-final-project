Welcome to the **Simple Interest Calculator**, a foundational tool developed by our microfinance startup to demonstrate basic financial calculations for underserved communities. This project represents our first step in transitioning from Subversion (SVN) to Git and GitHub, embracing open-source practices to empower developers and collaborators worldwide.

## 🌟 Project Mission

Our mission is to provide accessible financial tools to help low-income individuals make informed decisions. This simple script calculates interest on a principal amount over time, supporting transparency and financial education.

## 💡 Features

- Calculates **Simple Interest** using the formula:  
  `Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100`
- Lightweight, beginner-friendly code
- Open-source and community-driven

## 🧮 How It Works

A calculator that computes simple interest given the principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

### 📥 Input:
- `p` – principal amount  
- `t` – time period in years  
- `r` – annual rate of interest (percentage)

### 📤 Output:
- `simple interest = (p × t × r) / 100`

### 💻 Example:
For `p = 1000`, `t = 2` years, and `r = 5%` annually:  
`Simple Interest = (1000 × 2 × 5) / 100 = 100`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended).

python simple_interest_calculator.py

## The Process

You’ll be prompted to enter:

Principal amount

Interest rate (annual %)

Time period (in years)

The script will display the calculated simple interest and total amount.
